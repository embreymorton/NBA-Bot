# NBA_bot
The NBA Twitter Bot is a Python script that posts tweets related to NBA using the Twitter API. It selects tweets from a predefined list, including text content and optional media (images or videos), and posts them to Twitter. 

This project is designed to automate the process of sharing NBA-related content on Twitter.

* No longer works due to new cost restrictions on using Twitter/X API for educational purposes *
